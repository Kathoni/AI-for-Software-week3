# Automated Testing with AI – Login Functionality

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates automated testing of a login page using Selenium IDE, focusing on both valid and invalid credential scenarios. The goal is to evaluate success and failure responses from the system under test and explore how AI enhances the testing process.

## Framework Used

- **Tool:** Selenium IDE (.side format)
- **Test Case:** Login test with valid and invalid credentials
- **Base URL:** http://example.com/login (replace with actual URL if needed)
- **AI Support:** AI plugins improve test coverage by suggesting edge cases and auto-healing locators.

## How to Use

1. Open Selenium IDE in your browser.
2. Import the `.side` file into the IDE.
3. Set the base URL in Selenium IDE.
4. Run the test suite.
5. Observe results and verify against screenshots.

## Summary

Automated testing with AI significantly enhances efficiency and test coverage. In this project, Selenium IDE was used to simulate login functionality with valid and invalid inputs. The results, visualized in screenshots, show how quickly and accurately the test suite identifies correct and incorrect logins. AI helps reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and ensure broader test coverage by adapting to UI changes and auto-generating missing cases. This is especially useful in agile environments where applications evolve rapidly.
